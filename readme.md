# TheLostTree

Hi. I'm learning alot of things and hope to continue to do so.
<br>
I know these languages: <br>
- JS (only because of TS)
- TS (objectively the only way to write JS)
- C# (:heart:)
- Java (only because it's vaguely similar to c#)

## Coding Bucket List
- Unity 
    - *sigh*
    - shaders...
- C++
    - for use in USACO or something similar idk
- Blender
    - i'm vaguely interested lol
- Rust
    - if C++ doesn't work out
- Go
    - it kinda looks fun
- OpenGL
    - who doesn't like reinventing the wheel
- Svelte
    - it's a struggle tbh
